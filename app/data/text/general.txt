Arushi: Hi again Tobi! Just trying to get this back on top of your inbox and gauge your interest in connecting with our team.  The process of fundraising can often lead entrepreneurs to exhaust an expansive amount of time, money, and other resources, which if deployed/concentrated towards gradually building their business(es) could be way more beneficial. So where do you find a strategic partner to lift the weight of fundraising from your shoulder? Marquee Equity has an infrastructure of I-Bankers and Analysts that can support you with your fundraising process & get you in front of the right and relevant investors. Would you like to get on a call with our team sometime this week or next? You can directly access our calendar here https://bit.ly/3X7aKOR Looking forward to hearing from you!

Fatma: Thanks, Tobi for the connection. I am writing to introduce you to a new app we have developed, called Webbec (https://webbec.tech/). We just launched. Benefits for both devs and companies: ✅ For developers, our platform offers job listings but it is not based on job postings if it makes sense (I mean that we gave access to our clients so they can browse developers' profiles without requiring them to post a job). We created this platform so we can cut the bureaucracy from HR agencies and Outstaffing companies by letting our clients have direct contact with our developers so they choose and interview whatever skillset they need and like. ✅ For companies, our platform provides access to a pool of highly skilled and experienced IT professionals. We understand that finding the right candidate can be time-consuming and expensive, so we have created a platform that simplifies hiring and helps you find the right fit for your team. So as a developer, we invite you to join our platform today and take advantage of our solution. Together, we can help build a better future for the tech industry. Fatma PS: We would like to hear your technical feedback regarding our platform.
